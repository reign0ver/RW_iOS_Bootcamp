# RW_iOS_Bootcamp

Hey guys! Let me introduce myself:

My name is Andrés Carrillo,

My Discord Username is: kOda#4339

I'm from Colombia:).  I currently live in Medellín, but I'm from a small city called Cúcuta:)

About my experience as a programmer:

* I started to learn to program since I was to the University (2016), not the most commited TBH xD, but I'm taking this serious since about 10 months.
* I've work with Java (like for 2 months) on the server side and with some JSP.
* And currently Swift.  I started to learn Swift the last year, it was on August/September I honestly don't remember

I want to be one of the best iOS programmer anyone can meet.  To get knowledge by tons and helping others with all the knowledge  I'm getting along the way:)

By the other hand but not less important.  I enjoy by tons too playing at League of Legends.  So If you like League too, for sure we're going to be best friends xD.

Hope you can find all this content usefull for starting and to get better in iOS development.

Cya.  Love you, Andrés:]
