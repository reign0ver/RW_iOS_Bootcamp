# RW_iOS_Bootcamp

Hey guys! Let me introduce myself:

My name is Andrés Carrillo,

My Discord Username is: kOda#4339

I'm from Colombia:).  I currently live in Medellín, but I'm from a small city called Cúcuta:)

About my experience as a programmer:

* I started to learn to program since I was to the University (2016), not the most commited TBH xD, but I'm taking this serious since about 8 months.  (Today is 30th May 2020)
* I've work with Java (like for 2 months) on the server side and with some JSP.
* And currently Swift.  I started to learn Swift last year, it was on August/September I honestly don't remember

I want to be one of the best iOS programmer anyone can meet.  To get knowledge by tons and helping others with all the knowledge  I'm getting along the way:)

By the other hand but not less important.  I enjoy by tons too playing at League of Legends.  So If you like League too, for sure we're going to be best friends xD.  I'm also a really curious guy, always want to know everything, how everything works, why things are like they are and that stuff that just simply take your sleep away

Hope you can find all this content usefull for starting and to get better in iOS development just like I'm doing at this moment.

Cya.  Love you, Andrés:]
