#Struct or Class? :thinking_face:

As we know Apple recommends Struct all the time, unless you need a class feature.

So, my choice was a Class, but why?🤔

Okay, as we know a Struct is a reference type, which means that it's a copy value and its values are immutables.  By the other hand we have Classes that are reference types, but.. what this mean? Okay, this means that when you instance a Class the reference value it's stored on the heap memory :o, which also meaaanss that their properties are mutables because everytime we change a value of my class, they just go to the memory address and update the value :o,  That's great and seems that is what we need in this situation!! 

Seems obviously, but again, my choice was a Class😄
